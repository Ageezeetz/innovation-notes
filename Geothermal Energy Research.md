**Companies:**
- Dig Energy (https://dig.energy/?src=polymer.co)
	- Costs around 80% of normal cost of geothermal drilling
	- Focuses on shallow digging (not deep into the earth)
	- Uses water jets to bore small holes into the ground
	- Massively reduces drilling costs and allows for flexibility regarding placement
	- Market will be company based, meaning they will be supplying the drills, not servicing
- Fervo Energy ([Fervo Energy - Next-Generation Geothermal Projects](https://fervoenergy.com/)
	- Drills horizontally in geothermal reservoirs
	- Focuses on large geothermal drilling, not compact
	- Installs fiber optic cables to gather data and geographic information
	- Focuses on enabling a future of renewable energy
	- Use advanced data algorithms that help find the best sources of geothermal energy
	- Algorithms also optimize the flow distribution for the best heat mining efficiency
- Borobotics ([Geothermal Drilling | Borobotics](https://www.borobotics.ch/))
	- "World's strongest worm"
	- 2 1/2 meter tall, 150kg metal pole
	- Plugs into electricity outlet and has 86% less emissions than normal geothermal drills
	- Automated to travel around underground and can be done by one worker
	- Very silent drill ("Once in the ground, it is barely audible.")
	- It digs directly down and has automatic failsafe in case of emergency or if reaching an artesian
	- Allows very controlled and small digging, encouraging multiple geothermal generators
	- Digs 300m into ground (shallow geothermal energy)

General idea: 
Funding company, geothermal energy manufacturer, geothermal drilling service provider,

We're a company that is seeking investments from people that have a lot of money. We use funding to research further into geothermal energy and to provide funding to other companies. Other geothermal companies provide us with a share of their income. We gather funding to distribute it further to other geothermal energy companies. Our research would only be available to those who are partnered with us and everyone will work together, there will be no market competition among our partners. 

- **Audience**: Interested investors with a strong sense of justice? that coincidentally have a lot of funding money (enough to buy out entire companies frfr, very rich :money_face: :>)
- **Hook**: Talk about the ongoing crisis of global warming and it's current and progressing effects it has had on us now
- **Proposal**: Explain that a very viable and long-lasting solution is geothermal energy. Include the fact that companies are now progressively getting into the market, so it is better to invest now and have a big return later than to wait. Also explain that this allows accessibility of geothermal energy in lower class areas, which ensures fairness to all and would provide a very positive view for the public. It would also bring many benefits for low-income families and would open opportunities for donations for those in need.
- **Impact**: The general public... researching more regarding geothermal energy opens so many doors for the future, not just in Earth, but even further down the line! Economic benefits and positive public views for businesses who donate or support the program
- **Data**: WAHHH MORE RESEARCH TT WAHHHHHH I hungry :< dat why I sad :< FRICK... I want... FUD :P yumyumyum dumplings. I no eat dumplings tho, dunno y I say I eat but I said I eat so ;/
- **Call to Action**: Due to ongoing changes in the world and the market, a change will be done eventually. Why not be part of those who have already started helping the world change and in return receive benefits for doing good? Monetary donations will allow massive research improvements for companies world-wide, and the geothermal boost will be massive, allowing new innovation opportunities and lots of income due to contracts from other companies (they sign contracts to gain our support since you'll be providing US money, not them).
- The general idea is that they will be donating to my company/program... the money will be used for research and for supporting companies world-wide. In return for support, companies provide their services to our targeted customer audience. Providing heating and cooling for low-income communities will be the start to progressing as a society, all while ensuring Earth is nice and healthy. Possible partnerships would then be encouraged among partnered companies to find a best possible drilling mechanism for the future, all while ensuring that geothermal heating is being generated for many people.

how geothermal energy became more accessible

**grants**



Idea:
- We are a company that gathers funding to further promote and support shallow geothermal energy production around the world while still providing geothermal energy
- The goal is to increase the availability of geothermal energy and get ahead of the geothermal energy production market by funding companies working on shallow geothermal drilling
- We profit from requesting a % of total energy generated from each company, which then supplies to our own customers
