OpenAI Releases Sora2 ([Sora 2 is here | OpenAI](https://openai.com/index/sora-2/))
	- Sora2 released on September 30, 2025
	- OpenAI explains this as GPT-1 for video creation moving up to GPT-3.5 for video creation
	- Previous models would deform/morph objects to fulfil prompts
	- New model can create realistic, cinematic, and anime styles, also capable of generating very realistic sound effects
	- Has a feature called "cameos" which essentially allows you to put yourself into any Sora generated scene
	- Focus is to connect with others (social app)/make friends
	- Limiting generations per day for teens, stricter permissions, scaling up human moderators for bullying activity, parental controls, and privacy
	- **User wellbeing is their main goal**
Small geothermal rigs could help fix the expensive costs and increase availability ([Geothermal is too expensive, but Dig Energy’s impossibly small drill rig might fix that | TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/09/geothermal-is-too-expensive-but-dig-energys-impossibly-small-drill-rig-might-fix-that/))
	- A company called Dig Energy is creating more **compact geothermal drillers** to produce energy, making geothermal heating and cooling way **cheaper**
	- Claim that using these new rigs would **decrease drilling costs by 80%** and would **replace fossil fuel burners and furnaces**
	- Heating and cooling represent about 1/3 of the US's energy use, and can even go up to 40%
	- Typical geothermal energy generation is not cheap due to it's upfront cost, as it is really expensive
	**- About 1% of homes use geothermal energy, leaving the rest (99%) to use other sources (non-renewable, etc)**
	- There are **two types of geothermal drills**, one that **drills deep into the Earth**, reaching up to temperatures of hundreds of degrees, and others that one **dig a few hundred feet into the Earth**. These superficial drills generate a **low, but CONSTANT temperature (perfect for cooling/heating),** which is what Dig Energy focuses on)
	- Typical superficial drills use underground pipes to transfer tempered water to cool/heat; costs of installing these pipes and drilling is about 30% of the total cost of the operation. Dig Energy's strategy of using water jets to drill holes instead of using normal drills, decreasing costs
	- Holes generated by water jet drill is much thinner and cleaner than typical drill's holes; also goes in a straighter line, allowing placement of multiple generators closer to each other
	- Plan on selling devices to other drillers (companies)
California police pull over automated vehicle after illegal U-turn
	- No ticket was given
	- Faulty programming/issue
	- No repercussions for company nor for driver (no driver :/)
	- New law being released next year for moving violations towards motor vehicles
