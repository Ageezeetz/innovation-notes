**Far-UVC lamps are a better alternative than ventilation and filtration systems inside hospitals or places where bacteria is prominent.** [Seeing the light](https://www.worksinprogress.news/p/how-to-clean-the-air)
	- **Problem:** Pathogens in the air in shared spaces are not effectively controlled and antibiotic resistances are increasing, making humans more prone to future illness and sickness
	- **Solution:** Use far-UVC lights to widely control the spread of pathogens effectively while maintaining human safety
	**- Call to action: Far-UVC lights provide a much larger benefit for society than if they weren't being used by reducing pathogens in high contaminated areas much better than filtration/venting systems. Alongside government hospital funding, a percentage can be put aside to save up and provide entire Far-UVC light systems in hospitals most prone to epidemics and spread of large varieties of pathogens (bacteria/sickness).**
	**- Pitch:** Wavelengths of 254 nanometers are capable of deactivating pathogens by damaging their DNA structure, stopping their ability to replicate, rendering them harmless. There are many modern solutions for pathogen contamination in hospitals, with the most common methods being ventilation and filtration systems. While such systems are widely used and do work to a certain extent, ventilation and filtration systems are not as good of a solution as you might think. These systems are often inefficient (not fully cleaning the air inside the space and often bringing dirty air, from outside the building, inside), noisy (due to large fans providing strong enough suction to cycle air inside building), and not very cost-effective (high electricity consumption = high costs). In response to the negatives of using such systems, far-UVC lights are very portable and provide easier installation (lights are often just integrated into building easily), don't require much maintenance (no maintenance at all, if any, + replacement every year), and not noisy (lights don't produce sound). Although Far-UVC lights are expensive, the average cost per light being roughly $2,000, the cost can be dealt with through loans/government taxes, which can later be paid in full through a % of the income of hospitals. Far-UVC lights provide a cheaper, stronger, and more reliable solution to pathogen contamination in hospitals than ventilation and filtration systems.
	- While waterborne bacteria have been partially limited due to filtration systems and other solutions, airborne bacteria have not
	- A light with a wavelength of 222 nanometers does not cause irritation or negative physical effects on humans like higher wavelengths while still being capable of killing "deactivating" bacteria that crosses its path
	- There are many statistics regarding how effective the UV lamps were in hospitals when they were first created 
	- UV lamps were not as effective when transmission of pathogens was sudden (face-to-face exposure; buses, hallways, and other shared spaces)
	- Mercury-based UV lamps were also expensive and could irritate skin and eyes
	- As antibiotic discoveries start decreasing and resistance to said antibiotics increase, more people die each day
	- Modern UV beams are calibrated to fit the room, often needing recalibration if changes occur
	- Far-UCV light wavelengths are counted 230 nanometers and below, capable of disabling pathogens without hurting humans
	- In a 2024 study, far-UVC lights decreased the amount of virus in the air by 98% upon turning on (equivalent to 36 air changes/hour) in an enclosed lab mouse cage-cleaning room
	- Ventilation can be awkward and noisy to install and run, simply replaces air in a room with ***possibly*** clean new air, and requires energy to either cool or heat incoming air (because ventilation can be so noisy, it is often turned off or down, massively increasing chances of pathogen transmission)
	- Filtration requires energy and also may require cooling/heating of new filtered air
	- Modern far-UVC lamps are expensive due to their complexity, but mainly due to their primarily low, negative demand

**Dig Energy is creating a more compact, cheaper alternative for geothermal energy accusation** [Dig Energy... | TechCrunch](https://techcrunch.com/2025/09/09/geothermal-is-too-expensive-but-dig-energys-impossibly-small-drill-rig-might-fix-that/)
	- **Problem:** Geothermal energy is not used by many due to it's high costs
	- **Solution:** New cost-efficient drill that allows geothermal energy to be accessed without high costs
	**- Call to action: Currently, geothermal has only been 1% of buildings installations in the US due to it's high up-front cost. By decreasing the up-front cost and ensuring availability of geothermal energy to many homes and companies, carbon emissions would be greatly reduced and many more homes would have the ability to heat and cool their homes.**
	- Dig Energy created a compact water, proposing a drill that bores holes into the ground to create pathways for geothermal energy accusation
	- Their solution is said to cut down up to 80% of drilling costs, allowing geothermal energy to be accessed much more broadly, eventually leading to non-renewable fuel sources' importance decreasing
	- The drills focus on shallow geothermal systems where heat is constant, allowing for the same level of energy production year-round
	- Geothermal heating only account towards about 1% of building instillations in the US, so there is a large gap and availability for geothermal innovation
