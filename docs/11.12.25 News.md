**EV chargers as lamp posts** ([Using Street Lamps as EV Chargers - Tech Briefs](https://www.techbriefs.com/component/content/article/54104-using-street-lamps-as-ev-chargers))
	- A team of researchers wanted to address the issue of EV vehicle charging areas in urban locations.
	- They created a normal EV charger and integrated it with a lamp post
	- It is more cost effective, more convenient, and more environmentally friendly than normal EV chargers
	- They are still gathering more information regarding conveniency and social factors that might affect lamp post EV chargers (like temperature (too hot/cold), likeliness to buy EV, and which communities will have most EVs)
	- They set up a prediction AI that used 10 years worth of EV charging data to predict the most convenient/best location for the EV lamp post chargers
	- **In the comments**, I read someone mentioned that there would then be 100s of EVs on the lamp post power net, which is not designed to provide so much power, only designed for the lights (limitation/implication)
