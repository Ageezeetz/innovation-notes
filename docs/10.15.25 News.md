New England's last active coal plant has stopped operating
	- First region in the US without a coal plant
	- Before shutting down, energy production from coal plants in New England was only 0.22%
	- The coal plant was the biggest taxpayer when it was first build due to its large income
	- The amount of revenue the town manager received allowed tax rates to be low, eventually leading to a residential development boom
	- Additionally, the taxes received from commercial developments started over taking taxes from the coal plants, so it was no longer the best profitable option

	- The model used patterns from 2016-2020 and applied them to data from 2021-2022 to test how well the models worked
	- Used things like heart rate, respiratory rate, emergency department triage scores, and previous medical conditions
OpenAI has to work hard to make 1T over the next decade
	- OpenAI has done many contracts with multiple big companies for **computing power**
	- OpenAI is currently making roughly 13B in annual revenue from **only 5% of their user total users, which 70% of are paying $20/month** (regular users = ~800M, 5% of regular users pay for services, 70% of those 5% are paying $20/month), meaning they could be making a HUGE amount of money if more people subscribed
	- Danger in OpenAI industry failing leading to disruption of US market
OpenAI is partnering with Broadcom to deploy 10 gigawatts of Broadcom-specific AI accelerators
