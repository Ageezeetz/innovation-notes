**Companies:**
- Dig Energy (https://dig.energy/?src=polymer.co)
	- Costs around 80% of normal cost of geothermal drilling
	- Focuses on shallow digging (not deep into the earth)
	- Uses water jets to bore small holes into the ground
	- Massively reduces drilling costs and allows for flexibility regarding placement
	- Market will be company based, meaning they will be supplying the drills, not servicing
- Fervo Energy ([Fervo Energy - Next-Generation Geothermal Projects](https://fervoenergy.com/)
	- Drills horizontally in geothermal reservoirs
	- Focuses on large geothermal drilling, not compact
	- Installs fiber optic cables to gather data and geographic information
	- Focuses on enabling a future of renewable energy
	- Use advanced data algorithms that help find the best sources of geothermal energy
	- Algorithms also optimize the flow distribution for the best heat mining efficiency
- Borobotics ([Geothermal Drilling | Borobotics](https://www.borobotics.ch/))
	- "World's strongest worm"
	- 2 1/2 meter tall, 150kg metal pole
	- Plugs into electricity outlet and has 86% less emissions than normal geothermal drills
	- Automated to travel around underground and can be done by one worker
	- Very silent drill ("Once in the ground, it is barely audible.")
	- It digs directly down and has automatic failsafe in case of emergency or if reaching an artesian
	- Allows very controlled and small digging, encouraging multiple geothermal generators
	- Digs 300m into ground (shallow geothermal energy)

General idea: 
Funding company, geothermal energy manufacturer, geothermal drilling service provider,

We're a company that is seeking investments from people that have a lot of money. We use funding to research further into geothermal energy and to provide funding to other companies. Other geothermal companies provide us with a share of their income. We gather funding to distribute it further to other geothermal energy companies. Our research would only be available to those who are partnered with us and everyone will work together, there will be no market competition among our partners. 

- **Audience**: Interested investors with a strong sense of justice? that coincidentally have a lot of funding money (enough to buy out entire companies frfr, very rich :money_face: :>)
- **Hook**: Talk about the ongoing crisis of global warming and it's current and progressing effects it has had on us now
- **Proposal**: Explain that a very viable and long-lasting solution is geothermal energy. Include the fact that companies are now progressively getting into the market, so it is better to invest now and have a big return later than to wait. Also explain that this allows accessibility of geothermal energy in lower class areas, which ensures fairness to all and would provide a very positive view for the public. It would also bring many benefits for low-income families and would open opportunities for donations for those in need.
- **Impact**: The general public... researching more regarding geothermal energy opens so many doors for the future, not just in Earth, but even further down the line! Economic benefits and positive public views for businesses who donate or support the program
- **Data**: WAHHH MORE RESEARCH TT WAHHHHHH I hungry :< dat why I sad :< FRICK... I want... FUD :P yumyumyum dumplings. I no eat dumplings tho, dunno y I say I eat but I said I eat so ;/
- **Call to Action**: Due to ongoing changes in the world and the market, a change will be done eventually. Why not be part of those who have already started helping the world change and in return receive benefits for doing good? Monetary donations will allow massive research improvements for companies world-wide, and the geothermal boost will be massive, allowing new innovation opportunities and lots of income due to contracts from other companies (they sign contracts to gain our support since you'll be providing US money, not them).
- The general idea is that they will be donating to my company/program... the money will be used for research and for supporting companies world-wide. In return for support, companies provide their services to our targeted customer audience. Providing heating and cooling for low-income communities will be the start to progressing as a society, all while ensuring Earth is nice and healthy. Possible partnerships would then be encouraged among partnered companies to find a best possible drilling mechanism for the future, all while ensuring that geothermal heating is being generated for many people.

how geothermal energy became more accessible

**grants**



Idea:
	- We are a company that **gathers funding to further promote and support shallow geothermal energy production** around the world while also being a **geothermal energy provider**
	- The **goal** is to **increase the availability of geothermal energy** and **get ahead of the geothermal energy production market** by funding and partnering with companies
	- We **profit by requesting a % of total energy or income generated** from each company, which then becomes a diverse supply for our own customers

1. **Audience**: Investors interested in geothermal energy (shallow geothermal drilling businesses are secondary, since we need main source of investments first)
2. **Hook**: Will talk about the increasing need for renewable energy and how by getting into the market now will provide a huge benefit 
3. **Proposal**: Because geothermal energy is renewable and is the most consistent/reliable source out of all other sources, it will inevitably be the future for energy production. By investing in research/technology now, we are preparing for the future, eventually giving us a huge step forward compared to others
4. **Impact**: Through an increase in geothermal energy, accessibility becomes cheaper and more widespread, allowing those struggling financially to afford a system that will save them more money in the future. By participating in this mission, partners are supporting the accessibility of geothermal energy for everyone!
5. I need more research before I start saying numbers. 
	- Areas of interest: 
		- Reasons why geothermal energy is the future
		- Costs of shallow geothermal drilling and its returns (money equivalent of energy production)
		- Geothermal energy and its impacts on the lower class/those in need
6. **Call to Action**: As the future arrives, so will new ways to generate energy! Geothermal is the most consistent renewable energy source and is the future of energy production. **By joining the impact (vague)**, you are encouraging the future of geothermal energy and supporting renewable energy accessibility to all in need!
7. **Overview**: We are a company that receives funding from wealthy business owners and shallow geothermal drilling companies. We use that funding to support other shallow geothermal drilling companies and their research. These companies then provide us with a **share of the energy or income generated (needs refining, specify what)**. Using the energy, we then supply to our customer audience, which revolves around **those in need (lower class?) (specify whether we are supplying energy or connecting with other companies, etc.**. Using the income, we continue to fund and further technological research regarding shallow geothermal drilling **to ensure we stay on in front of the future**.
