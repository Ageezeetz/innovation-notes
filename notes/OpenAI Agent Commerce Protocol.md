**What is the OpenAI Agent Commerce Protocol?**
	- Similar to how Google's A2A Protocol is, OpenAI's AC Protocol allows for users to interact with AI Agents (ChatGPT, etc.), which interact with merchants to complete purchases
	- Goal is to let AI Agents (ex. ChatGPT) act on behalf of users to discover, negotiate, and finalize purchases
	- Under the protocol are three different Specs
		- Specs are essentially just protocols inside of protocols (minor protocols)
		- **Product Feed Spec:** Focuses on how merchants share information the user can see (reviews, inventory, product detials (color, size, etc), prices, etc.)
		- **Agent Checkout Spec:** Provides user with live changes that are visualized using the ChatGPT UI that appears after selecting a product given by the Agent, allowing users to view updated information after changing any product specifications (amount, color, design, size, etc)
		- **Delegated Payment Spec:** Allows OpenAI to share single-use payment tokens generated by the user's Payment Service Provider (PSP), which works like a coupon/voucher that holds monetary value and the user's payment authentication. Passing this token to a merchant is considered as a form of payment, but with extra security, ensuring that user information isn't given while still being able to pay for products.
	  
**How it works:**
	1. Users **prompt** AI Agent with product/search query
	2. Agent **connects with merchant APIs** created to communicate with Agents efficiently
	3. Merchant does heavy lifting; **validating orders**, **calculations** (tax, etc), **inventory checks**, and other things
	4. **Agent then returns information** to user, where user determines whether to buy product or not
	5. Any interactions with Agent features (pressing Purchase for item, changing product settings like color, size, quantity) are relayed to merchants to recalculate information
	- Users can go from prompting to buying in **one chat**
	- **Interactions** between User, Agent, and Merchant **are all secure**
	
**OpenAI Agent Commerce Protocol Examples**
	1. Housewarming gift for friend
		- Prompt: **"Can you help me find a great housewarming gift for my friend? Maybe a homemade ceramic dinnerware set, in white and tan, under $100"**
		- Agent searches for merchants providing **similar** products (may rank results off of **cheaper products**, **seller ratings**, or **popularity**)
		- **Agent showcases relayed products** using customized UI (1. Stone Dinnerware set, 2. Ceramic Black Dinnerware set, 3. White and Tan Dinnerware set)
		- **User buys** given **product** off interface, connecting merchant to the PSP for transaction
		- Merchant checks if everything aligns (inventory, fraud checks, etc) and confirms/declines the order
	2. Birthday gift
		- Prompt: "**Find me a videogame for PS4 for my friend's birthday. Has to be below $25 and must be well known**"
		- Agent searches for merchants providing similar prompted products ($20 God of War, $14 Dying Light, $8 Far Cry 4)
		- Agent **showcases the videogames** using the interface
		- **User changes quantity of products bought**
		- **UI updates** to showcase new total price
		- **User buys products** off of the ChatGPT chat
		- Merchant checks if everything aligns (inventory, fraud checks, etc) and confirms/declines the order
