Huntington's disease treated for the first time
	- After 40yrs of age, symptoms appear, and life expectancy is ~20yrs more (~60yrs life ex.)
	- Treatment slowed disease by 75% (time after symptoms is 4x more (20 * 4 = 80yrs))
	- Patients expected to live decades of "good quality life"
	- Trials are being done with patients without symptoms to determine if possible to entirely stop disease

UVC light can cleanse the air we breathe to destroy all the bacteria it contains [Seeing the light](https://www.worksinprogress.news/p/how-to-clean-the-air)
	- First started by an experiment where sun did not allow a specific bacteria to grow in a tube
	- From there, scientists tested to find which wavelengths of light removed the bad bacteria
	- 254-nm light caused viruses, amoeba, and bacteria in the air to be destroyed while only causing sunburn-like irritation on skin
	- 1936, a doctor used the UV radiation to cure airborne infections, decreasing infection rates from 11.6% to 0.2%; 0/2463 cases died from infections
	- Other hospitals followed shortly after, recording cross-infection decreases of 40% to 96%
	- During Philadelphia's largest epidemic of measles, only 14.5% children fell ill while under UV light, while 55% fell ill not under UV light
	- Ventilation works, but is not good in highly populated areas with bad air outside
	- Filtration works, but may bring extra costs (having to heat or cool down the air for correct temperatures)
	- Ventilation is still needed in conjunction with the Far-UVC light, as it determines how fast the lights come across contaminated air
	- Currently, no credible well-working Far-UVC light products have been created
AI tool research information may not be reliable
	- Studies were done to ask GPT-40 model to determine if specific articles were retracted (all of them were checked by humans to see if they were retracted), and a very small amount of the retracted articles were correctly identified as retracted
	- This happened to other AI research-focused tools where, when asked a question based off the retracted papers, the AI models used the retracted research papers for evidence 
	- Concerns are raised if the data used to train AI models is up to date
	- Retracted papers are copied and shared throughout the internet, increasing the availability of the paper
