**How to accurately represent surroundings of city in VR?**
	1. Drone capture/Drone operators
		- Similar to how Google Maps and other companies use vehicles with cameras to create virtual spaces for environments, drones would be sent out to scan environment to relay more accurate, higher texture mapping of surroundings.
		- This allows human agents/operators to visualize problems faster and easier, also allowing faster descriptions of situations towards responders
	2. How?
		- Meta has released a tool called Hyperscape for VR where you can simulate your surroundings (physical space) into virtual reality
		- Using Hyperscape, it could be possible to combine their system with drone capture to update VR agents' visuals in **real-time** while carrying out a task, or providing **accurate, more detailed** visual representations of the environment through VR
		- Drone capture would not be extremely accurate, as it would still be taken relatively far away, but it would be accurate enough to be usable by VR agents
	3. Police/Government/Commercial use of drones
		1. Police
			- Drone use for hostage/standoffs, active shooters, drug interdictions, and bomb threats
			- Drones would relay information to police, providing feedback and active data, which is used to plan and react according to the situation
			- Also used to map out buildings, surroundings and relay environmental information to first responders
		2. Commercial
			- Companies use drones to inspect pipes, infrastructures, and transmission lines using thermal imagery
			- Also used to inspect architecture for faults (cracks, breaks, snaps; bridges, sinkholes, rails, etc)
		3. Government
			- Use of drones, robots, and AI to automatically repair roads (cracks)
	4. Perspectives
		1. Government
			- **Want:** Efficient problem detection/repairs, emergency response times, low danger risk for first responders, cost savings
			- **Worries:** Surveillance concerns, airspace safety, drone traffic conflicts, rule compliance, **liability**, costs
		2. Commerce
			- **Want:** Reduced downtime, data for predictive maintenance, reduced labor costs, competitive advantage
			- **Worries:** Liability, up-front investment costs, data ownership, interoperability
		3. Citizens/Public
			- **Want:** Faster fixes to infrastructure issues they care about, safer environment, reduced disruption, transparency
			- **Worries:** Privacy, misuse of data, safety, job displacement
		4. Drone/VR/Robotics Companies
			- **Want:** Ability to innovate, cybersecurity
			- **Worries:** Costs/slow deployment, tech issues, safety, reputation
		5. Possible Solutions:
			1. **Privacy**: Automatic blurring of any important details that may void privacy rules; blurring should occur from the moment the picture is taken to ensure that any data transferred is already safe for privacy + blurring process does not have to be extremely detailed; once image gets sent to base, further blurring will occur to ensure proper privacy. Data would be stored for a set period of time, discarded afterwards, for training purposes, data collection, and security reasons (rule of allowing suing only during the lifetime of specific data)
			2. **Airspace safety**: Comcast can claim partial ownership of the general used airspace or come to agreement of sharing airspace for general safety benefits; (1) government and Comcast would have full visibility of Comcast drones (each will have a chip that can be tracked), (2) normal civilian drone pilots would have to register with Comcast/government drone program for free; this would allow people to know which area pilots are using to fly, ensure that Comcast drones don't interact with civilian drones, and would make immediate clearing of an airspace for emergencies possible, and (3) will allow Comcast to organize/plan drone actions smoother and more efficiently (without worries).
			3. **Security**: Program prioritized on minimizing citizen and environmental damage; in case of emergencies, drone will crash AWAY from humans and environment, will be able to use environment for safety (landing on water, tree to soften landing, etc), and will tend to take expensive risks for human safety. Robots will be created with strong computing power to ensure that decisions are properly and calculatively made, leading to overall low expenses and quicker reactions to situations.
			4. **Costs**: Drones will be made with sufficiently powerful resources to ensure that drone actions protect the most amount of people while also minimizing costs for repairs. Better software = better actions; initial costs are expected to be fairly high due to drone and robot hardware costs + labor + software testing and training. Government grants/support and companies focused on providing societal help (construction companies, etc.) would be main sponsors of program since they will be receiving large benefits for a program that isn't intended to provide help for their services (purpose is for faster Comcast fixes; has large side-benefits for society). Comcast will also be paying their part to support this program and initialization (testing).
	5. Additional drone use (**robot automation**)
		- Along with drone capture, it is possible to use drones (automatically or with human operators) to transport and deliver automated workers (robots) into specific tasks that can be handled without the need of human interference (dropshipping???)
		- Drones would transport robots towards problem area, deploy them in their respective work areas, and once robot finishes their task, drone would pick up robot and deliver back to base
		- Robots would be programmed and trained aggressively on specific tasks (fixing traffic lights, mending stop signs, replacing fuses, etc.) to ensure proper focus and highest success rate 
		- The use of said robots can be provided to companies and even the government, increasing chances of providing funding + greatly increasing public opinions
	6. Relay drone data through VR feed or Website?
		- **Short answer: Both!**
		- VR Feed:
			- **Allows VR human operator to visualize situations**; provides more detailed context to robot/human worker, ensuring proper preparations for task
			- **Easy organization of incoming information/documents**; data can be automatically shown in different formats (graphs, arrays, etc) for quick and easy understanding, everything is easily moveable so the difficulties of papers or files is no longer a problem, and sorting information would be much easier virtually with essentially infinite space to store "floating windows of information"
			- **Simple controls**; currently, VR human operator would use normal VR controllers (or maybe customized controllers) to control everything inside the VR space, controllers are easy to learn and have little to no complex uses
		- Website:
			- **Allows real visualization of data in a more recognized pattern/format**
			- **Ensures that information is accessible in a much wider range**; website can be used anywhere, whereas VR headsets are momentarily/in-place tools
			- **Capable of using information through different sources**; information can be customized and displayed in car screens to provide information on the go, can also be accessed by robots easier if formatted differently (information has to eventually be formatted down to a simple format that robots can understand (VR -> website -> bits?)), and mobile use through cellphones or any other tele-related devices
			- **Possibility of providing as customer resource**; provides customers with understanding/situational knowledge on the current issue/problem, could be used as a way to track progress of problem's estimated fix time, allows customers to see current issues in their area and possibly report new issues
	7. AI Ethics
		- 






- Using drone capture to accurately represent locations/areas in VR using Hyperscape. (Xfinity Vision) (not from the top of a building, or on the streets. Midway point between the two)
	- Avoids the action of having to go there and scan the surroundings in person or using cars and scanners
	- Does not provide extremely accurate representation of surroundings, but accurate enough to map and provide useful information
- **Robots to fix problems**
	- Drone dropshipping (manual driver for very crowded spaces, automatic driving for open/empty spaces) or van transportation of robots (**DOORDASH ROBOTS DELIVERY**)
	- Robots specifically created for certain tasks (fixing lamp posts, traffic lights, stop sign repairs)
	- Provide services to other companies to fix their products (creating custom robots to suit their needs)
	- Provide services to government to get funding where robots would fix easy, highly repetitive issues, thus decreasing human workload ```
